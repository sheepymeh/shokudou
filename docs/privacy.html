			<p>
				We care about your privacy greatly. That's why our service collects as little information as possible to keep you anonymous.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your TraceTogether IDs are never stored on any disk - ever. IDs are only used to sync the different receivers, and thrown out immediately after processing the data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our graphs are generated using aggregated data. We only save the number of people in the canteen at any given moment, not who was there.
			</p>
			<p>
				The BlueTrace protocol changes your ID every 15 minutes, so we cannot track you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Servers running this app are secured and have strict access controls to keep your data safe and secure.
			</p>
			<p>
				Don't take our word for it - our project is <a href='//github.com/sheepymeh/shokudou'>open source</a>.
